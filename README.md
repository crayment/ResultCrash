## A project demonstrating some crashes in the Xcode 10 beta

Run [the tests](ResultCrashDemoTests/ResultCrashDemoTests.swift). On Xcode 9.4 they run and pass. On Xcode 10.0 beta 4 they crash.

### Xcode 10 beta 4 update:

One crash remaining that no longer has anything to do with Result. I have simplified [the tests](ResultCrashDemoTests/ResultCrashDemoTests.swift) to show it more clearly.
